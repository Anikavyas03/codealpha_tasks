# Task 3: Sentiment Analysis

This is my internship Task 3 submission for CodeAlpha.

## 📌 Description
A simple Sentiment Analysis project using a small IMDb-style dataset.  
The model classifies reviews as either **Positive** or **Negative**.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, Scikit-learn
- NLTK (for stopword removal)
- Logistic Regression
- TF-IDF Vectorizer

## 🧠 How It Works
1. Dataset is cleaned using lowercasing, punctuation removal, and stopword filtering.
2. TF-IDF is used to convert text into numerical vectors.
3. Logistic Regression is trained to classify the reviews.
4. The model predicts sentiment of test reviews and custom inputs.
